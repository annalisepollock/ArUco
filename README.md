Ok

run navigation.py in to open up navigation. RN if you hold a marker in front of the camera it will decide what marker it is and decide on left or right.
We need to implement actually moving using headcontrol file, we also need to work on the head tilting towards the marker, I have started to implement that, but hunter gave us a method
in some lecture that we need to decide where the camera needs to point. 


If you write code on your computer and push it to the robot, you will need to re calibrate the camera by running calibrate.py and hold the checkerboard pattern in front of it. 
Press c to have the camera take a picture. Take a bunch of pictures of the checkerboard in different locations and press q when finished. This might just be a me problem though cause I 
can't use the camera on my laptop.
